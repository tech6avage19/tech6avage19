# 2025-05-05 – Daily Cybersecurity Log

**What I Studied**: 
- Security+ Section 6: Network Hardening
- Practiced scanning ports with Nmap

**Wins**: 
- Built my first scan with `nmap -sV`
- Noted which ports were open on default Ubuntu VM

**Reflections**:
- I like this hands-on method more than just reading

**Tomorrow’s Focus**:
- Azure VM firewall config
- Flashcards for ports
